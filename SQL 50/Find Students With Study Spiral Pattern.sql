Table: students

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |
| major        | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
student_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a student and their academic major.
Table: study_sessions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| session_id    | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| subject       | varchar |
| session_date  | date    |
| hours_studied | decimal |
+---------------+---------+
session_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a study session by a student for a specific subject.
Write a solution to find students who follow the Study Spiral Pattern - students who consistently study multiple subjects in a rotating cycle.

A Study Spiral Pattern means a student studies at least 3 different subjects in a repeating sequence
The pattern must repeat for at least 2 complete cycles (minimum 6 study sessions)
Sessions must be consecutive dates with no gaps longer than 2 days between sessions
Calculate the cycle length (number of different subjects in the pattern)
Calculate the total study hours across all sessions in the pattern
Only include students with cycle length of at least 3 subjects
Return the result table ordered by cycle length in descending order, then by total study hours in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:

Alice Chen (student_id = 1):
Study sequence: Math → Physics → Chemistry → Math → Physics → Chemistry
Pattern: 3 subjects (Math, Physics, Chemistry) repeating for 2 complete cycles
Consecutive dates: Oct 1-6 with no gaps > 2 days
Cycle length: 3 subjects
Total hours: 2.5 + 3.0 + 2.0 + 2.5 + 3.0 + 2.0 = 15.0 hours
Bob Johnson (student_id = 2):
Study sequence: Algebra → Calculus → Statistics → Geometry → Algebra → Calculus → Statistics → Geometry
Pattern: 4 subjects (Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Geometry) repeating for 2 complete cycles
Consecutive dates: Oct 1-8 with no gaps > 2 days
Cycle length: 4 subjects
Total hours: 4.0 + 3.5 + 2.5 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 3.5 + 2.5 + 3.0 = 26.0 hours
Students not included:
Carol Davis (student_id = 3): Only 2 subjects (Biology, Chemistry) - doesn't meet minimum 3 subjects requirement
David Wilson (student_id = 4): Only 2 study sessions with a 4-day gap - doesn't meet consecutive dates requirement
Emma Brown (student_id = 5): No study sessions recorded
The result table is ordered by cycle_length in descending order, then by total_study_hours in descending order.
