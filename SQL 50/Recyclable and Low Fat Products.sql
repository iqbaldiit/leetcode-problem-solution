--- Create Table 
CREATE TABLE Products (product_id INT, low_fats CHAR(1), recyclable CHAR(1))

--- Insert Data
INSERT INTO Products VALUES (0,'Y','N')
INSERT INTO Products VALUES (1,'Y','Y')
INSERT INTO Products VALUES (2,'N','Y')
INSERT INTO Products VALUES (3,'Y','Y')
INSERT INTO Products VALUES (4,'N','N')

--- Solution
SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats='Y' AND recyclable='Y'
--- Drop table

DROP TABLE Products
