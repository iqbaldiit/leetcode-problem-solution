## Biggest Challenges
This section lists our the biggest technical challenges and their solutions.

1.	Handling Concurrent user access in real time:   
    a.	Challenges:
        i.	As multiple races can be run simultaneously and infinite number of user both spectators and cyclists can be logged in, user concurrency is a biggest challenge and it should be 0 RTO.
        ii.	Risk of API throttling, slow response times, and race data inconsistencies.

    b.	Solutions:
        i.	Implement connection pooling and session management to optimize resource uses and rate limiting to prevent API abuse and backend performance. 
        ii.	Unique namespace for each race and partitioning based on particular races. 
        iii.	Use microservice architecture to isolate the service.

2.	Real time tracking and latency
    a.	Challenges:
        i.	While racing, track racer (GPS, lap time) data needs to be processed and updated in <1 second. If there is any delay, user experience will suffer.
        ii.	Consider minimum battery drain on mobile devices because, the race might be run for long time and device battery time is very important.
    
    b.	 Solutions:
        i.	Use Device GPS to track racer positions and push data to the server. High throughput messaging ques to manage event process efficiently. Like AWS Kinesis data stream.
        ii.	Use persistent connections and data synchronization using even driven communication for instant data updates like AWS AppSync.
        iii.	Use SQLite database for temporary racing data so that if connectivity lost, data can be synced while connected.
        iv.	Compress the data before transmit so that low connectivity canâ€™t affect the transmission.

3.	High availability and fault tolerance 
    a.	Challenges:
        i.	The system should stay operational even if some components fail.
        ii.	Avoid single point of failure in the architecture.

    b.	Solutions:
        i.	Design multi region deployments to ensure uptime and 0 RTO.
        ii.	Implement automatic failover mechanisms. 

4.	 Security and Authentication
    a.	Challenges:
        i.	As lot of users will access concurrently, security and authentication is big challenges.
    
    b.	Solution:
        i.	Use token-based authentication.
        ii.	User Role based authorization like admin user, racer as user, spectator as user as the system requires. 
        iii. Data can be encrypted at rest and in transit.

![High Level Architecture Diagram](/assets/diagram-placeholder.png)

On the basis of application context, technology familiarity of the organization, Scalability, High availability, performance and business continuity, hybrid model using AWS Serverless and microservice architecture is well suited.
1.	AWS Serverless: cost efficiency, scalability and simplicity. Well suited for backend APIs including all administrative functions, user management, race configuration and so on.
2.	Containerized Microservice is for real-time processing and high performance. Avoid connection managements challenges of pure serverless.

Architecture overview
1.	Client Applications
    a.	Mobile App Tracker uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) via AWS IoT real time telemetry.
    b.	Web & Mobile App for general user integrate via API Gateway (REST) and AppSync for live updates.

2.	Authentication: AWS Cognito manages authentication with security of API and web socket access.

3.	Real time data processing: 
    a.	AWS IoT Core + Kinesis computes live telemetry.
    b.	Lambda Aggregation processes events before storage.
    c.	Timestream efficiently handle data for analytics

4.	Microservices (AWS Fargate)
    a.	Auto-scaled WebSocket (Node.js) service for real-time communication.
    b.	Redis (ElastiCache) for low-latency real-time data retrieval.

5.	Backend Service (AWS Lambda)
    a.	Handles User, Race, and Admin Management with minimal overhead.
    b.	AWS S3 for static data and DynamoDB for operational data.

6.	Data Layer
    a.	DynamoDb for user profile, race configuration and other operation.
    b.	For historical, statistical or analytics ready data we need transformation. So we load data to AWS S3 Data Lake from timestream db through ETL Glue  and send it to the Aurora Database.
    c.	Dynamodb transform and load the data to Aurora through lambda.

    b.	Node.js + WebSocket-> Handles live event updates for the race dashboard.
    c.	AWS ElastiCache (Redis) -> Caches race data for low-latency performance.
    d.	Fargate Auto-scaling -> Ensures dynamic scalability during high traffic.

    b.	AWS DynamoDB-> key value storage for user profile, administration and race related data.
    c.	AWS S3 Data Lake -> Stores aggregated race history and statistical data.
    d.	Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL) -> Stores structured analytics data and supports SQL-based queries.
    e.	AWS Glue -> for ETL data pipeline.

9.	Deployment & DevOps:
    a.	AWS ECS (Fargate)-> for container orchestration. Manages containerized workloads without managing servers.
    b.	AWS CDK -> Infrastructure as Code (IaC). For automating AWS infrastructure provisioning
    c.	AWS CloudWatch-> Tracks system performance, logs API requests, and traces transactions.
    d.	AWS CodePipeline / Github action -> for Automating application deployment.

10.	Security & Compliance:

    b.	AWS KMS -> Encrypt sensitive race data at rest and in transit.
    c.	AWS WAF -> Protects against unauthorized access and attacks.

## Runtime Cost Analysis
*[Todo: Do the runtime cost analysis in this section]
