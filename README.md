| **Fargate**             | $0.04048/vCPU/hr + $0.004445/GB/hr       | Depends on task size and runtime duration                      | Used if you move parts of app into containers (e.g., image processing).|

### üîÅ Scaling Summary

- Every **1 million requests** (via API Gateway + Lambda) ‚âà **$3.70‚Äì$4.00**
- Every **1 GB of additional storage** ‚âà **$0.02‚Äì$0.03**
- Adding real-time data processing (e.g., Kinesis or Fargate) introduces variable compute/storage pricing.
- Logs, notifications, and stream data scale **linearly** with user and event growth.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Services like **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB On-Demand** scale seamlessly, but costs accumulate based on throughput.
- Proper **monitoring** and **auto-scaling configuration** is essential to prevent runaway costs.
