The following is the base cost (No User). In serverless mode there is no base cost nearly 0 or 2 to 12 USD /month (because of some "alawys on"  Service)

### Core Service Cost

| Service                     | Provisioned Type / Tier           | Monthly Base Cost (USD) | Reasoning                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS Lambda                 | Provisioned Concurrency = 1       | ~$3.20                   | $0.0000041667/sec per 1 concurrency x 730 hours (~1 month).               |
| Amazon API Gateway         | REST API (Regional Endpoint)      | ~$3.50                   | $3.50/month for regional endpoint + $1/million requests if any.           |

| Amazon AppSync             | Min Provisioned Units             | ~$4.00                   | Provisioned GraphQL resolvers; base price even if unused.                 |
| Amazon Timestream          | Base Storage Tier                 | ~$2.50                   | Even without writes, storage tier incurs a base charge.                   |
| Amazon Kinesis Data Stream | 1 Shard Provisioned               | ~$15.00                  | $0.015/hr/shard x 730 hours/month; no scaling.                            |
| AWS Fargate (ECS)          | 1 Task (0.25 vCPU + 0.5GB RAM)    | ~$7.00                   | Fargate min task = ~$0.01025/hr => 730 hrs/month = ~$7.49                 |

| **Total Estimated Base**   |                                   | **~$50.80 â€“ $55.00**     | All provisioned with minimal specs; always-on even with no user activity.|

### Infrastructure Service Cost

| Infrastructure Service | Monthly Base Cost (USD) | Description                                                                 |

| **AWS IAM**            | $0.00                    | No cost for creating users, roles, policies.                               |
| **AWS KMS**            | ~$1.00                   | $1/month per key, even if not used. Used for encrypting data at rest.      |
| **AWS CodePipeline**   | ~$1.00                   | $1/month per active pipeline. First pipeline is free.                      |
| **AWS CDK**            | $0.00                    | Free CLI/SDK tool. No runtime cost.                                        |
| **AWS WAF**            | ~$5.00                   | $5/month per Web ACL + ~$1/rule/month (estimate based on 3 rules = $3).    |
| **AWS CloudWatch**     | ~$2.00                   | Base monitoring + minimal logs (e.g., metrics retention and alerts).       |


### Cost Breakdown When Scaling Up (Monthly)

Scenario: A race event with 50,000 concurrent viewers and 50 riders. This triggers higher compute, streaming, and data handling demand.
